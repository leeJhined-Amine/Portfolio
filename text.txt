Not my best design, but still not bad i'd say, the css is a complete mess, i worked on this project over *long period of time* which lead to some confusions and lack of clarity (should've used comments), you might encounter a lot of unnecessary stuff. other than that, everything should be good.
might find some minor (major tbh lol) flaws, depends on the screen.
This should a good brief explanation about the code lol.
