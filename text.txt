Not my best design, but still not bad i'd say, the css is a complete mess, i built this project in a *long period of time* which lead to messing my thoughts about what i was doing (should've used comments), you might find a lot of useless stuff. other than that, everything should be good.
This should a good brief explanation about the code lol.
